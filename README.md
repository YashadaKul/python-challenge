# python-challenge
This is the submission for module 3 assignment for the Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp (Feb - Aug 2024).

The submission contains two main folders, PyBank and PyPoll, each with folders for Resources, Analysis and a .py file called main.py.
The python files have the code for the assignement, while the results are in the respective analysis folders. 

I referred a few sources online for this assignemnt. These are the main ones:

    1. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2918362/writing-string-to-a-file-on-a-new-line-every-time

    2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1841565/valueerror-invalid-literal-for-int-with-base-10

    3. https://www.javatpoint.com/find-key-with-maximum-value-in-dictionary


I also got help from a friendly classmate for a piece of code I was stuck with. While she did not give me the answer directly, she nudged me in the right direction.
